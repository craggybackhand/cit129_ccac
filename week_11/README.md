# Using tree_traversal.py

tree_traversal.py is a simple script that traverses a file tree to count the number of files in it, the number of .jpgs in it, and the average 
filesize (in KB).

It takes a directory filepath as an input argument. A sample directory with several jpeg files is included in OneDrive_1_4-15-2020.zip. To run
the script with this sample directory, simply type:

`python tree_traversal.py -d HorrorMovies_SaraD`
