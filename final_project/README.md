# Brickset API Viewer

----
## Functionality
The Brickset API Viewer allows you to view aggregated information about Lego sets from a range of years that you specify. It calls the Rebrickable API documented [here](https://rebrickable.com/api/v3/docs/?key=). It will give you information about the average number of pieces in sets over time, as well as the largest and smallest sets from each year in the range.

----
## Usage
1. Open brickset\_final\_project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Enter valid start and end years in the first cell. The script will tell you if you've entered a value that cannot be processed as a year.
3. Click **Cell** > **Run All** in the menu. 
4. Allow the API viewer time to run. It will take longer to return information if you enter a wider range of years and if the years contain a large number of sets.
