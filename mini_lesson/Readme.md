This directory contains files demonstrating how to use the argparse module in Python. arparse_handout.pdf covers the most common use cases, while argparse_example.py and parsing_baseball.py provide two examples of how argparse can be used in a program.

## Challenge: 

If you havenâ€™t done so already, rework an existing script that requires user input to
use argparse instead. Remember to anticipate which user input is required and which is
optional. Also, keep in mind that you might have to validate the input passed with an
argument!
